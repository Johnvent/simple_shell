cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Changes the shell working directory.

    Changes the current directory to DIR.  

    Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    Null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with (/), CDPATH is not used.


    The options:
      -L        force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic
                links in DIR after processing instances of `..'
      -P        use the physical directory structure without following
                symbolic links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before
                processing instances of `..'
      -e        if the -P option is supplied, and the current working
                directory cannot be determined successfully, exit with
                a non-zero status
      -@        on systems that support it, present a file with extended
                attributes as a directory containing the file attributes

    Exit Status:
    Return 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; else, non-zero.
